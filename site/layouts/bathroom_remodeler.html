The average cost to remodel your bathroom in 2021 is about $8,000-$20,000. This includes everything that needs to be fixed. From new tile and fixtures to a tub or shower surround replacement. \nThe size of the bathroom is one of the biggest factors in how much it costs to remodel.\nIf you have an extensive project,  such as removing a wall to open up another room, it can cost quite a bit of money. \nHowever, some people choose to keep their bathroom small, or avoid making changes at all. This might save them money in the end."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you remodel a bathroom for $5000?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It all depends on what you want done. Probably not. It is possible to spend $5000 on a bathroom. But it would probably be a very simple remodel. Such as replacing cabinet doors and installing a new sink.

The most important one is the floor. You can choose a different kind for the floor from what it has now. The most popular choice for many homeowners is tile. Many people would agree that tile is the best option for bathrooms. It is easy to clean and maintain. It's also one of the most common choices for homeowners. Tile is very popular because it is seen as a classic option and will match many styles, such as vintage or modern.\nAlthough tile floors are the most popular choice, they can also be one of the more expensive options. If you want to install tile flooring in your bathroom, then the price could go up quickly."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long do bathroom remodels take?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The amount of time it takes to complete a project depends on how much needs to be done. If you are just doing cleaning and minor touchups, then you may only need 1-2 days for your team to finish.\nIt is possible to quickly redesign a bathroom. However, you might be looking for a bigger job. Like adding new shower or tubs, as well as different layouts and features. The project will take longer as those are more time-consuming."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"When to remodel bathroom?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"There are many reasons to remodel a bathroom. Some people choose to update their bathrooms when they move in. Others wait until the current fixtures need replacing.\nIf you have an outdated bathroom that has become too small for your family, then it may be time to consider a remodel. When remodeling a bathroom, room expansion is  not always an option. This is where you can work with the appliance and the material to gain useful square feets.\nMany homeowners decide to make changes to their bathroom as it is hard to clean or repair the old fixtures. They want a bathroom with more space and new features.\nIf you have a bath or shower that needs replacing, it might be time for a remodel."}}]}</script>
